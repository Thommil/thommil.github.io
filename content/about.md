## 1 - BEING VISIBLE
Through this website and all contents relative to what I do and who I am, this place is the best resume I can provide (the summary is available on homepage).

## 2 - BEING FRIENDLY
I share demos hosted here for recruiters, partners, developers. I didn't want to display a 404 homepage, so previously I put an amazing meme instead:

<div class="big-img">
    <img src="/images/meme.jpg" alt="Crappy meme"/>
    <figcaption>Previous version of thommil.com</figcaption>
</div>

#### I found it very funny but feedbacks were not as good as expected!

## 3 - BEING CREDIBLE
 * **1998**, I created a copycat of Facebook which was developed in ... **2004**,
 * **2001**, I developed my own AJAX framework, AJAX was introduced in ... **2005**,
 * **2006**, I developed and published a successful serverless commercial solution,
 * **2008**, I've offered the recipe of Pineapple Kebab to the world (and the world was not ready).

Do you believe me? Do you think these achievements were valuable? We don't care as I can't show you.

<div class="big-img">
    <img src="/images/facebook.jpg" alt="TL;DR"/>
    <figcaption>TL;DR</figcaption>
</div>

That's why I dug in my repositories, rebuilt several of my old projects and made videos, to keep a trace, here.

So, if I can give you an advice, **old fashion style**:
<div class="blink">
    <div>
        <span>
            <img src="/images/kitten.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px"/>
        </span>
        <span>KEEP A TRACE OF YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS</span>
        <span>
            <img src="/images/kitten.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px"/>
        </span>
    </div>    
</div>

## 4 - BEING RETROGAMING
Also, let's talk about retrogaming on handhelds, the devices and how to explore the massive amount of games created since 1978.

    <img src="/images/space_invaders.png" style="max-width:200px; margin:20px"/>
</div>
